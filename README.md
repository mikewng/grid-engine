This application is to provide a lightweight and modular game engine for 2D-Grid Combat Games.

Currently, I am modeling its gameplay structure and loop based off of series such as Fire Emblem and Advanced Wars.

To Run:
1. Clone Repository
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Web application will run on localhost 3000 by default.
